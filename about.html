            <p>
                If you didn't get it from the homepage, I'm Benedykt Staples (username: bene_dictator) and I study law at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, NZ. I like to write and edit stories, and was for a long time a content reviewer on the open source game Endless Sky. I am also a 3d modeller using Blender, soon hoping to learn Fusion360 to be able to design parts for my other hobby: nerf blaster modding and electrical soldering.

                Aside from those, I also play the piano, am trying out the ocarina and guitar, study Spanish at an institute in town and speak some Mandarin at home; do a bit of drawing when I feel like it; have tried many times without success to start to learn how to program; and now I try to run a little website.

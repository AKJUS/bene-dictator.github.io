            <p>
                I'm Benedykt Staples and I'm a law and commerce student at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, NZ. I like to write and edit stories, and was for a long time a content reviewer on the open source game <a href="https://www.github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky">Endless Sky</a>. I'm trying to learn 3d modelling with Blender and especially Fusion360, so that I can design parts for my other major hobby: Nerf blaster modding and electrical soldering.

            <p>
                Aside from those, I also:
                <ul>
                    <li>play the piano;</li>
                    <li>study Spanish;</li>
                    <li>speak some Mandarin at home with my mum, when I can;</li>
                    <li>try to draw with mixed results;</li>
                    <li>read quite a bit of whatever (lately a lot of Scandanavian noir...);</li>
                    <li>watch old detective and police procedural shows;</li>
                </ul>
                and now I try to run a little website.
            </p>
            <p>
                I suppose the goal of this website is to try to learn more about myself and what I experience. Whenever I feel like reflecting or putting something into text, I'll try to post something on the website to help me understand what I'm trying to get at. A lot of the time, it will just be ramblings about Nerf concepts or mods I've completed, but some of the posts are quite personal, too. I choose not to think about the audiences of the posts (if any), but I hope that whoever reads them can understand something about themselves through my experiences, too.

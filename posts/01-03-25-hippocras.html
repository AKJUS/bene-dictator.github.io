            <h3>Posted: 01/03/2025</h3>
            <p>Hippocras is a type of spiced wine originating from the middle ages. This recipe for hippocras is derived from recipes from the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries.</p>
            <p>Thanks to my friend Ethan for preparing and researching this drink and letting me post his recipe on my website.</p>
            <h2>The ingredients</h2>
            <p><i>For the drink (per litre of wine):</i></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Dry red wine</li>
                <li>175g white sugar</li>
                <li>8g cinnamon (preferably whole sticks)</li>
                <li>6.5g grated ginger (double or more if using fresh)</li>
                <li>2g cloves (preferably whole)</li>
                <li>0.5g nutmeg</li>
                <li>0.5g mace</li>
                <li>0.5g galangal (or 1.3g fresh or frozen)</li>
                <li>1g cardamom</li>
                <li>A short sprig of rosemary</li>
                <li>1.3g ground pepper (reduce or 0.6g or less if freshly cracked)</li>
                <li>0.5g marjoram OR oregano (fresh; use less if dried)</li>
                <li>1.3g caraway</li>
            </ul>
            <p><i>Optional ingredients:</i></p>
            <ul>
                <li>100 mL to 200 mL brandy or other wine spirit (3 to 7 shots, to taste)</li>
                <li>1g grains of paradise</li>
                <li>1.75g long pepper</li>
                <li>0.2g spanish lavender (nard)</li>
                <li>0.2g savory</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>The process</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Add all ingredients to a bottle with the wine, shaking intermittently to dissolve all sugar.</li>
                <li>Leave in a cool, dark place for a day, shaking to upset the sediment whenever convenient.</li>
                <li>After one day, filter it through a fine enough sieve that it comes out with no silt, then bottle it until you intend to serve it.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Hippocras is traditionally served as an after dinner digestif at room temperature, but it would also be good hot or cold, or with soda water.</p>
            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The one served at dinner (25th of February, 2025) did not include mace nor optional ingredients aside from brandy (2.5 shots), and used part fresh ginger and part dry ginger.</li>
                <li>Galangal is actually very easy to get at Asian and Indian supermarkets, frozen. I have yet to see dried galangal.</li>
                <li>Spanish lavender is available (usually year round) at most plant nurseries. It is also called topped lavender or French lavender, Latin name Lavandula stoechas. Just use the flowers. It should smell reminiscent of musk.</li>
                <li>Grains of paradise can be purchased from specialty stores and some African supermarkets, but I've never seen them in NZ.</li>
                <li>Long pepper can be purchased from some South Asian and South East Asian supermarkets, but I've never seen them in NZ.</li>
                <li>Never seen savory in NZ but it is in use in some European cuisines.</li>
            </ul>

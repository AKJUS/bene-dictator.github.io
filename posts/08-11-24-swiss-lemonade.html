                What do you get when you mix limes, water, condensed milk and Brazilians? Swiss lemonade. As the friend who introduced me to this "sacriligeously good" drink lamented, "it's too bad condensed milk is so fucking bad for you because its too good". (Recipe from <a href="https://braziliankitchenabroad.com/brazilian-lemonade/">Brazilian Kitchen Abroad</a>, rewritten here for easy access / in case that website goes down for whatever reason.)

                Being my first year out of high school and the first year where I largely lived by myself without others to help me, this year has ended up becoming a really significant year for me, Not particularly because I got much of note done, at least compared to last year. In fact, it's probably a rather dead year in terms of physical achievements. No, what really happened was an emotional shift. I have a few people to thank for that.

                University is different to what I experienced at high school, half because I was responsible for figuring out my day and how to feed myself (though I am both lucky and unlucky that I don't have a job... though I really should get some formal work experience) and half because of the fact that so many more people are around - most importantly, girls. Since I've been taught in single-sex schools since year 6, this is actually a fairly big deal, even if it sounds rather pathetic.
            </p>

                But that's the truth; university was fundamentally different because of the difference in my social life. My high school life was complicated, not least because I was both in and out of the boarding school and because of covid, but also because I used to be far more into video games than I am now. And being in the dorm room after school doing nothing but map-painting on an overheating MacBook is not a social activity. The problem is, university in New Zealand doesn't afford you the pre-set social group that high school affords you with its mandatory English classes and whatever. What I had for friends in high school either moved for university or work elsewhere, or were in different parts of the University of Canterbury. And in addition, I lost interest in most of what I did in the past (more on this later). Therefore, more effort was required on my part to both maintain and develop my social sphere.

                Relationships are always odd because there is always some expectation that you are meant to be in one of some sort. Coming to terms with the fact that you can be better off without that is difficult, but the way to find out whether that is the case is easy (and in fact can be applied to many other things): if you start to realise that you are sacrificing your life because you like the idea of something more than the reality of it, then you need to do something fast, or you're lying to yourself about what's truly best for you. In my case, it was because I liked someone in my law class. But because I was so lonely this year with my parents leaving for overseas for two months and the pseudo-depression I felt during the uni break weeks before my mum came back (and really extending further afterwards), I got anxiety out of the fear of this one girl who I really know was just not that much interested in my attention.

                The solution, therefore, was to get rejected by her as fast as possible. Actually, I shouldn't really phrase it like that, but honestly, I asked her out because I was so anxious to get rid of my anxiety around her. I understand the patheticism behind it, but it was necessary to move on much like anything else in life. With great doubt that she'll ever read this thing, I have to thank her for saying no, because it's better to know than to not know, and at that time, what I really needed was to focus on my school work, not to chase after this vapid idea that I would be with someone who would rather not be. It did not stop me from losing focus to other girls over the rest of the year, but this one time was easily the most significant. I think about the moment sometimes; it's not so much an embarassing moment (what is embarassing about being told the truth?) as it was a moment of closure, and really, happiness. (Billy Joel has a good song about this, though it kinda assumes your success in that scenario; but the truth is, the sooner the better.)

                What ties into this is the fact that (as funny as it may sound) things don't matter as much as they may seem. Decisions, attractions, whatever; every little thing isn't worth stressing about. In addition, it's a lot easier to be yourself than to be what you think the other person sees as an ideal. Not only is that a moving target, it's pathetic to live your life to the standards of someone else. I like to think that I am far more honest than otherwise (mostly because it is easier to give the truth than to conjure a lie) and I would think that even in my most needy hours around the people I was interested in in the first eight months of the year I conducted myself in sincerity and honesty. (Yes I really was born in China and can speak Mandarin. No I can't write or read because Chinese characters are one hell of a time sink. Godspeed to you for learning it...) But it doesn't stop me from appearing ungenuine nor trying to overly impress. The thing is, it's not necessary to impress. Actually, it's not necessary to think that hard at all. Ideally, a person may conduct themselves to the point that a need to impress is unnecessary. Why put in any effort at all? That may sound odd, but I am honestly saying that it's not necessary to put in effort to impress others. The effort needs to be put in on improving yourself, not creating false images of yourself for short term gains for the sake of other people's approval. (If anything, don't be George Costanza.)

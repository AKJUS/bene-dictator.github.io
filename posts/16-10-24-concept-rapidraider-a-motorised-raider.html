                I have been recently collecting drum magazines to go with my modified Elite Titan CS-50, and because of that I have been finding a couple Raiders CS-35 along the way. Raiders are from the N-Strike era of Nerf when Hasbro used the inefficient reverse plunger mechanisms in their blasters, and because of this, internally they are rather useless. However, I love the unorthodox form factor of the Raider, and so I've decided to try and overhaul one... by giving it motors and flywheels.

                I am not actually the first to think about motorising a Raider. A reddit user named "Deus-Vult42069" (anonymity on the internet...) wrote a series of posts on /r/Nerf and /r/NerfMods on their project to do the same thing (<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Nerf/comments/m8aso6/i_have_an_idea/">[1]</a>, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Nerf/comments/ma5cx8/nerf_raider_sg_ideaprototype_2/">[2]</a>,<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Nerf/comments/miw01a/switches_glued_in_on_the_raider_sg_shell/">[3]</a>, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Nerf/comments/mqzcle/well_everything_now_fits_just_need_to_sort_a_few/">[4]</a>, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Nerf/comments/ye8jv8/this_might_just_work/">[5]</a>, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Nerf/comments/ykd17d/raider_rapidstrike_conversion_internals_for_those/">[6]</a>) Initially they consider using a Stryfe-like pusher mechanism to feed the darts into the flywheels, but later on discover that a Rapidstrike's automatic pusher fits well into the shell of a Raider.

                Rapidstrikes are rather difficult mods because of its automated pusher mechanism. It requires a third microswitch to detect whether the position of the pusher has fully retracted (if it hasn't, it will retract it to ensure there are no jams), and this is rather difficult to position. The Rapidstrike has had various kits which make this easier (the one I've had the most success with is BlasterTech's mounting bracket), but we have to improvise a little for the Raider. Luckily again, we can draw inspiration from previous mods. "Deus-Vult42069" adopted a suggestion somewhere along the way to mount their microswitch on the pusher's side, in a way similar to veteran modder torukmakto4 in <a href="http://torukmakto4.blogspot.com/2017/06/brushless-inrunner-ar-cage-continued.html">his brushless auto-Stryfe build</a>. The microswitches arrived on the 14th, as a matter of fact, and

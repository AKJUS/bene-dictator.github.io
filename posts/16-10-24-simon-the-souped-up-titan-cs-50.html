            <p>
                A few months back I spotted a Titan CS-50 for sale on a local auction site for NZ$40. Seeing as these went for NZ$200 when they were in circulation, this was too good of an offer to pass up. However, because the Titan uses four C size batteries, it only has 6V to power its four motors, leading to quite an anaemic performance for a blaster of its size. The solution, of course, was to rip everything out except the conveyer belt feeding assembly and replace it with ridiculously sized motors that ran on far more powerful batteries.
            </p>
            <p>
                My first plan attempted to maximise what a 7.2V NiMH battery could handle. For this, I bought a pair of 180 sized Wolverine motors for the flywheel motors and a 120 size Neo-Badger for the conveyer motor (I kept the stock motor for the revolving barrel detail). Shell modification to fit the Wolverines was minimal because the Titan is massive. However, I had significant trouble with the screws because of this; they're quite far set into the blaster shell and none of my screwdrivers fit... and I ended up with some horrifically stripped screws.

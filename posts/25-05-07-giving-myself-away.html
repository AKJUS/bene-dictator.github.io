            <p>
                I parked the car right outside her house this time so she wouldn't have to walk far in the dark. The welling in my stomach was intense. I pulled on the handbrake and turned to look at her.
            </p>
            <p>
                    I don't know why I always wait until the last moment to get the most important things done, but I did it then, and I still do it now.
            </p>
            <p>
                    "Thanks for dinner. I enjoyed it," she said. I smiled, but I wasn't sure of myself. I wished things had gone differently - at the same time, I knew they couldn't have gone any different. It didn't really matter.
            </p>
            <p>
                    She was about to open the door. "Hold on," I heard myself say. I tried to look into her eyes, it didn't make much difference in the darkness of the car. All I could see was a dim vignette of her face from the light down the street where I'd only driven down twice before and probably wouldn't drive down ever again.
            </p>
            <p>
                    "I've got something to tell you."
            </p>
            <p>
                    Her first instinct was always humour. "What? So you are pregnant!"
            </p>
            <p>
                    She already made the joke earlier in the night, but I laughed anyway because I was caught off guard.
            </p>
            <p>
                    "No, no, of course not!"
            </p>
            <p>
                    I looked back down at the steering wheel, it didn't really help.
            </p>
            <p>
                    "It's something I've meant to tell you for a while."
            </p>
            <p>
                    "So what is it?"
            </p>
            <p>
                    My head grew number. I was overthinking it, but it was a bit late now. How was I meant to say this to her?
            </p>
            <p>
                    How was I meant to say this to her?
            </p>
            <p>
                    She continued to look at me from her side of the car. For whatever reason I leaned onto her shoulder, the way she used to lean on me the first time we got to know one another; or when we sat at the bench at Mona Vale watching the ducks on the pond, the day before I flew to New York. That used to mean a lot to me, it still did then when I sat in my car with her.
            </p>
            <p>
                    "I don't know how to say this to you, but I... I've had feelings for you for a long time."
            </p>
            <p>
                    It felt wrong, but it was the right thing to say. It was the truth.
            </p>
            <p>
                    "But... I don't feel like I can act on them."
            </p>
            <p>
                    I didn't hear anything. I realised my eyes were closed. I opened them.
            </p>
            <p>
                    As always, she dealt with life on humourous terms. "Is it because I'm an old hag, huh? Is that why?"
            </p>
            <p>
                    "No, no... you're better than that. I just... I don't know. You're better than twenty-five."
            </p>
            <p>
                    "I'm not even twenty-five, I'm twenty-four."
            </p>
            <p>
                    "You're better than that. It's just... I've carried it with me for so long, I didn't know what to do. You're better than twenty-five..."
            </p>
            <p>
                    The moment felt inexorably long. I took my head off her shoulder and looked at her. "It's why I said I had some things to say in person. I just didn't feel comfortable texting that to you."
            </p>
            <p>
                    Her glasses still glistened in the shine of the streetlight. "I get that. You can tell me anything you'd like, over text even." She laughed. "But just because you've told me your feelings doesn't mean you get to cut me off!"
            </p>
            <p>
                    "Of course, of course. And don't you do the same to me, either!"
            </p>
            <p>
                    We laughed again. "It's okay, Ben... I'm sure you'll find somebody. Maybe someone else from our group."
            </p>
            <p>
                    I didn't know what to say. I always felt differently about her. It was for the group's sake that I chose to throw myself away anyway.
            </p>
            <p>
                    "Maybe this will help," she said. She gave me a hug. A proper one.
            </p>
            <p>
                    "Thanks... it did help."
            </p>
            <p>
                    She smiled again.
            </p>
            <p>
                    "Well, I'm glad I told you that. That takes a lot off my mind... it was the reason why I invited you to dinner. But I couldn't bring myself to say anything, until the end..." There was another pause.
            </p>
            <p>
                    "I suppose I've got to let you go now."
            </p>
            <p>
                    "Yes, I suppose I do have to go." She opened the door. "Thank you again for dinner."
            </p>
            <p>
                    "Goodnight," I said as she stepped onto the pavement, and she turned back to look at me, just before she walked up her parents' driveway.
            </p>
            <p>
                    "I love you."

            <p>
                Music is something I frequently look to when I want something to reflect my own emotions. And since it's been such a... weird university term for me, what's been going on my voice recorder (dictaphone if you want to be fancy!) that I use as an mp3 player has been changing a lot over that time. I imagine it must be similar for a lot of people, that what they listen to is rooted in what they feel. And I can't do anything but write about what I've been feeling.

                <i>Closing Time</i> is really interesting to me; I didn't know about Semisonic before this (I had heard their song <i>Secret Smile</i> before, though) and I actually encountered them through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZNaNfAzfIA">this unironically amazing mashup</a> which I found linked on a website on chord progressions. Ostensibly it's a song about a bar closing, although it is really about the birth of Dan Wilson's first child... and what appeals to me especially, about how life is going to be irrevocably different.
            </p>
            <p>
                What is poignant about the music video, though, is that Dan Wilson and his date never get together.

                <i>Scar</i> by Missy Higgins might be the song that has described my past five months the best. I think the song can sing for itself. It is yet another song about moving on, coupled with the danger of becoming too involved in someone. Last term I suppose I was on the receiving end of this one as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Would she leave me with a scar?

                Sometimes I try to play these songs on my keyboard, though I'm still no good at transcribing music. I have been trying to learn chords and more music theory lately to help. But at the moment, reading music is the main way I play the keyboard. Billy Joel is one of my favourite artists (though my Canadian dad may object) and quite a bit of his music does appeal to me. I really quite like <i>Vienna</i> - it also warns of being over-invested, being too showy without enough to show for it, and the need to get your bearings; to know what you actually need for yourself, to realise when someone or something isn't worth it, that going after it will hurt you.

            <p>
                But the Billy Joel song I have been playing on the piano lately has been <i>And So It Goes</i>. Playing it kind of reminds me a bit of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mFO_sjmYFk"><i>I Vow To Thee, My Country</i></a> (the most beautiful church hymn I have ever sung). But, <i>And So It Goes</i> just relates to me at the moment. I've been trying to return my friendship to how it was, but it still feels so difficult at times, through no fault of her own - just my own jealousy... But this song feels gentle; it's Joel in grief, wishing it were different but acknowledging the position of his lover. It was Joel's choice to let go. Which is what I'm trying to do at the moment... it feels like I've never had more motivation to write than ever, to play the piano than ever - love does that I guess. I hope I get to play it for someone sometime, but it's not ready yet.

            <p>
                On the other hand, I have <i>Tenderness</i> by Paul Simon, which is more... plainly put out and careless, I guess. I don't really know if I like too too much where it doesn't apply to me. It kind of describes how I felt when I had disconnected myself from her for a few weeks after the fact. I don't think honesty is a waste of energy - but while I feel like it's something I live my life by for good, I should stop doubting myself. I have this feeling that I will get the better of myself through honesty. It sounds absurd, but I almost feel like it prevents me from finding tenderness...

            <p>
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVX80UpMPDI">But is tenderness actually what I need?</a> Or should I just focus on myself, instead of other people? I just want to try and be less apathetic... even though that's how I feel like I've had to act towards her recently.

            <p>
                Lastly we have a New Zealand song, <i>Loyal</i> by Dave Dobbyn. I love the bells, which you can also hear in another Kiwi classic, <i>Slice of Heaven</i>. I find this song funny - I don't know whether Dobbyn achieves his love here. I want to feel like it's a platonic song... settling into a deep friendship and being true to that, with no reservations as I continue to feel at times. And I aspire to this. Can I stay loyal, to my feelings and hers? Will I live without having to cut myself off again? I have many questions I wish I could ask her, but honestly, I can't make myself ask her. If she could only read this and form her own conclusions.

            <h2>Honourable mentions</h2>
            <p>
                A list of other songs that I've just associated with my relationship to her, whether fairly or unfairly. They all deserve a blurb, but I've written so much already...

            <p>
                I feel so much through all of the songs I have here. They have just been playing on repeat in my life. Every time I drive to the Port Hills alone, I have my mp3 player on max volume. I'm singing to nobody at all, at the top of my voice. And I sing of how afraid I am, in awe of how others can act so freely where I couldn't have considered before. The energy they have, the energy she has, what I lack and how much I wish I could have it. I'm going 70ks on the Summit Road and watching the lights moving independently of my own struggles and feelings. I sing for her still. But I have to move on.
            </p>
            <p>
                But finally... a proper masterpiece from Paul Simon, from his album Graceland.

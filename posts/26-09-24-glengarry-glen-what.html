                <i><strong>Spoilers for the movie Glengarry Glen Ross. Watch it if you haven't already, even if you hate Alec Baldwin. You'll probably hate him more after watching it.</strong></i>

                Quite a bit earlier this year a friend of mine informed me that I just don't watch enough classic movies, and I've been trying to take her advice to heart. While not _exactly_ a classic - it's kind of well known but it's not had an incredibly staying effect, I suppose - I still think it's a pretty decent movie on mismanagement and seedy, cutthroat business.

                Oddly, it has become one of those movies like American Psycho or whatever where the people it tries to portray in a (perhaps) satirical way end up being the ones who weirdly embrace it against the movie's original meaning. Apparently some office managers like to put "Coffee Is For Closers" on their mugs. Which, well, I suppose isn't _terrible_ (certainly not comparable to people imitating Bateman's wake-up routine... or worse) but it misses the point about how management's role as mediator between a business' goals and what happens on the ground to make those goals into reality.

                When you try to discuss this movie, it's impossible to avoid mentioning the sole scene with Alec Baldwin's character, Blake. Well, I already have mentioned it when I talked about those manager coffee mugs. Chances are that if you've done a bit of diving into the movie's background you know that this scene was not in the original play, and was written for Baldwin personally. I find that quite interesting because the original script has the contest in the background, but in the movie - while the "sales conference" feels slightly shunted in, because of how small of a timespan the movie operates in (less than 24 hours) - it's an adequate way of giving Ed Harris' character (Dave Moss) the motivation to do the deed that eventually kills the charades game.

                By the way, Al Pacino does a real great job of being the salesman who almost makes us feel as if he is redeemable - only to realise he's just as crook as the rest.

            <h3>Posted: 31/01/2025</h3>
            <p>
                Before my stepdad left for Sri Lanka yesterday, he taught me a recipe to use at home. So I am doing my thing and entering it into my website so that I don't lose it!
            </p>
            <h2>The ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 length of beef ribs</li>
                <li>2 carrots</li>
                <li>2 celery stalks</li>
                <li>2 onions</li>
                <li>1 tin of tomatoes, or 2 to 3 tbsp of tomato paste</li>
                <li>4 cups of stock</li>
                <li>garlic powder</li>
                <li>onion powder</li>
                <li>herbs of your choosing (e.g. sage, oregano, thyme...)</li>
                <li>2 to 3 bay leaves, preferably fresh</li>
                <li>red wine</li>
                <li>salt and pepper</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>The process</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Set the oven to 160ÂºC. Put olive oil into a pot and heat it up on low.</li>
                <li>Drain the blood from the ribs, then wash it.</li>
                <li>Place the ribs on a cutting board, fat side down. Make cuts between the ribs. Slice off unnecessary excess fat from the bottom</li>
                <li>Place the ribs into the pot, fat side down, to brown. It takes each side of the ribs about 5 minutes to brown.</li>
                <li>Take the ribs from the pot and set aside, and remove the fat collected the pot.</li>
                <li>Dice the onions, carrots, and celery and cook them in the pot to soften. Add the tomatoes or paste to fry as well.</li>
                <li>Add 2 to 3 tsp of garlic and onion powder and half to 1 tsp of salt to the pot.</li>
                <li>Once the vegetables are softened, place the ribs back into the pot, fat side down once again.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle herbs lightly over the meat and add the bay leaves. Also add pepper.</li>
                <li>Pour red wine into the pot until it fills the pot to halfway up the meat in the pot. Then, pour stock in until all of the meat is covered. Bring the pot to a boil.</li>
                <li>Place the pot into the oven for two and a half hours.</li>
                <li>Once done, take the pot out of the oven and serve.</li>
            </ol>

                This was an interesting challenge because I had only really worked with flywheelers in the past. My first mod was a retaliator (and I have also upgraded a Magnus before), but I didn't actually realise how springers worked. Knowing that N-Strike blasters used reverse plungers, I realised when I found this on FB Marketplace for about NZ$35 that I'd have to do a fair bit of work to fix it up. The biggest part was figuring out how direct plungers actually work (rather simple, actually). For that reason I think this is probably the most rewarding mod I've done so far.

                The internals are a mix of a worker retaliator plunger tube and some 3D parts; specifically, the breach and "plunger conversion block" from <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6072294">here</a>, the low compression spring rest from <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4681960">here</a>, and the catch from <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3498904">here</a>. I originally used a retaliator catch and some hot glued parts from Stryker's files but accidentally cut more of the shell than I should have, leading me to fall back to the 3d printed catch by kbja. There is also a 7kg retaliator spring in there.
                I'm very happy with this because the Longstrike is a bit of a holy grail blaster for me, and in the process of modding it I also learnt much more about how nerf blasters work than I would have if I kept swapping springs. Although not war practical (20m at best), "True Blue" is going to have a special place in my heart for teaching me so much.

            </p>
            <h2>The ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 cup (4 fl oz/125 ml) extra virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>2 sweet white onions, cut into 1 inch (2.5 cm) pieces</li>
                <li>1 leek, white sort only, cut into 5 inch (12.5 cm) pieces</li>
                <li>1 cup (8 fl oz/250 ml) Madeira wine, at room temperature</li>
                <li>9-10 cups (72-80 fl oz/2.25 2.5 l) chicken stock</li>
                <li>3 cups (21 oz/655 g) Arborio or Carnaroli rice</li>
                <li>2 cups (12 oz/375 g) chopped cooked chicken meat <i>(see Note)</i></li>
                <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                <li>Salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>The process</h2>
            <p>
                In a large, heavy saucepan, heat 1/4 cup (2 fl oz/60 ml) of the oil over medium-high eat. Add the onions and leek and saute until the onions turn golden brown, about 15 minutes. Add the Madeira and deglaze the pan, stirring to scrape up the browned bits from the bottom. Cook over medium-high heat to reduce the liquid by half. Meanwhile, in a saucepan over medium heat, bring the stock to a singer simmer and maintain over low heat. Add 1 cup (8 fl oz/250 ml) of the simmering stock to the onion mixture and continue to cook over medium-high heat until the liquid has reduced and the mixture is quite thick, about 15 minutes longer. Set aside.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the onions simmer, in another large, heavy saucepan, heat the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil over medium heat. Add the rice and stir until each grain is well coated with oil and translucent with a white dot in the center, about 3 minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Add the simmering stock a ladleful at a time, stirring frequently after each addition. Wait until the stock is almost completely absorbed (but the rice is never dry on top) before adding the next ladleful. Reserve 1/4 cup (2 fl oz/60ml) stock to add at the end.
            </p>
            <p>
                When the rice is tender to the bite but slightly firm in the center and looks creamy, after about 20 minutes, stir in the chicken. Cook to heat through, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter, caramelised onion mixture, and reserved 1/4 cup stock. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve at once.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>Note: Use leftover roasted chicken or poached chicken breasts. To poach chicken breasts, put 2-3 bone-in breast halves in a lange saucepan and add lightly salted water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes.</i>
